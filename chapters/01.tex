\chapter{Introduction}

In recent years, mobile gaming has experienced exponential growth, yet many games fail to deliver the sophistication needed to sustain player interest. Traditional dice games, with their straightforward mechanics and strategic depth, offer a unique opportunity for innovation. However, current mobile dice games often fall short due to predictable AI behavior and limited analytics \cite{bib:appannie}. These limitations result in gameplay that feels static, with easily exploitable strategies and little feedback to help players improve \cite{bib:yannakakis}. As a result, players struggle to stay engaged, often facing steep learning curves without meaningful insights into their progress.

\section{Objective of the Thesis}

This thesis aims to overcome these challenges by developing an advanced mobile dice game application that reimagines classic gameplay with modern technology. The application will feature an adaptive AI opponent capable of accessing player behavior to deliver a dynamic and evolving challenge. This approach ensures that gameplay remains engaging and rewarding, catering to players of all skill levels.

To enhance the gaming experience further, the project incorporates virtual screen technology to simulate real-world dice interactions, bringing the tactile excitement of traditional dice games into the digital space. Additionally, a comprehensive analytics system will track detailed performance metrics, offering players personalized insights and fostering long-term engagement.

By combining these innovations, this thesis seeks to redefine mobile dice gaming. Through adaptive AI, virtual interactions, and meaningful analytics, the project bridges the gap between classic dice games and cutting-edge technology, setting a new benchmark for the genre.

\section{Overview of Thesis Chapters}
This thesis is organized into seven chapters. Chapter 1 introduces the mobile gaming landscape and dice games, along with the motivation behind this project. Chapter 2 analyses the problem, exploring the mechanics of dice games, the role of AI in gaming, and mobile app architecture. Chapter 3 outlines the system requirements, architecture design, data model, user interface, and AI model design. Chapter 4 details the external specifications, including the development of the Android application, integration with TensorFlow Lite, and the implementation of player analytics and game mechanics. Chapter 5 focuses on the internal specifications of the project, covering unit testing, integration testing, and user acceptance testing, as well as performance analysis and evaluation of the AI model. Chapter 6 addresses verification and validation to ensure the system meets its requirements and functions correctly. Finally, Chapter 7 concludes the thesis by summarizing its key elements, highlighting its achievements, limitations, and suggestions for future improvements.
